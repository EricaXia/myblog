What inspires me about data science is...
* The possibilities and discoveries to be made. I enjoy "connecting the dots" from the data, and discovering patterns and trends.
* Getting creative with elements of storytelling and problem-solving
* Building data-driven products to turn ideas into concrete implementation
* Optimizing systems and processes
* The chance to learn and apply new things in an ever-evolving field!
