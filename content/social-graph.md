This project focuses on the detection of potential threat actors on GitHub. We accomplish this by discovering the users who interact with proof-of-concept CVE repositories and analyze their relationships using **social graph network analysis**. Detecting potentially malicious users who interact with software exploits is the first step towards the process of threat attribution in cybersecurity.

The software repositories investigated are gathered from the [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures records](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) created by MITRE.
