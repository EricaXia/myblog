### Supervised

*Supervised algorithms require labeled training data to train a prediction model and check results.*

- Linear Regression ([write-up](/regression-overview) | [notebook](/))
	- Stepwise
	- Lasso
	- Ridge
	- ElasticNet
	- MARS

- Logistic Regression

- [k-Nearest-Neighbors](/knn)

### Unsupervised

*Unsupervised algorithms don't need labeled training data to run, and they are often used to find patterns or groupings in the data.*

- Clustering
	- k-means
