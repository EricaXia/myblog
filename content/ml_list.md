### Supervised

*Supervised algorithms require labeled training data to train a prediction model and check results.*

- Linear Regression ([write-up](/regression-overview) | [notebook](/))

	- Lasso
	- Ridge
	- ElasticNet
	- MARS

### Unsupervised

*Unsupervised algorithms don't need labeled training data to run, and they are often used to find patterns or groupings in the data.*
