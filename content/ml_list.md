Master list of machine learning algorithms I contribute pages about.

### Supervised

*Supervised algorithms require labeled training data to train a prediction model and check results.*

- [Regression](/regression-overview)
	- Linear
	- Logistic
	- Lasso
	- Ridge

- [k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN)](/knn)

- [Decision Trees and Random Forest](https://ericaxia.github.io/notebooks/random_forests_1.html)

- Naive Bayes

- [Support Vector Machines](https://ericaxia.github.io/notebooks/svm_1.html)

### Unsupervised

*Unsupervised algorithms don't need labeled training data to run, and they are often used to find patterns or groupings in the data.*

- Clustering
	- k-means 
	- [Archetypal Analysis](/archetypal)
